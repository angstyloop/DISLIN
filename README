1.) Introduction

   DISLIN is a high level and easy to use graphics library for displaying
   data as curves,  bar graphs,  pie charts,  3D-colour plots,  surfaces,
   contours and maps. The software is available for several C, Fortran 77
   and Fortran 90/95 compilers.

   The UNIX versions of the graphics software  DISLIN  are distributed as 
   compressed tar files with the file names 'dislin-n.m.xxx.tar.gz' where
   'n.m' contains the DISLIN version while the part 'xxx'  identifies the 
   operating system or compiler.  

   Notes: - This distribution of DISLIN supports programming on Intel
            machines with Mac OSX 10.x. It supports the compilers
            gcc, g77, g95, gfortran, Intel icc and ifort. The included
            DISLIN libraries are compiled for 64-bit. 

          - Precompiled 64-bit modules for Perl, Python and Java are 
            included. 

          - An installtion of OpenMotif is necessary for using DISLIN. A
            compatible .dmg package of OpenMotif can be downloaded from
            https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmotif-mac/

2.) Installation of OpenMotif for Dislin

a)  Download the file OpenMotif-Mac-10.5-2.1.dmg.zip from the site
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmotif-mac/

b)  Open the .dmg file with a double-click and copy the directory OpenMotif21
    to the Applications folder.

c)  Change to the /Applications/OpenMotif21/lib directory in a terminal 
    window and create the link  libXm.dylib to libXm.3.1.dylib:

    cd   /Applications/OpenMotif21/lib
    ln -s   libXm.3.1.dylib   libXm.dylib  

    Linking with OpenMotif can then be done with the options

    -L/Applications/OpenMotif21/lib -lXm


3.) Installation of the tar.gz Distribution

You should have root access to install the tar.gz distribution since the
install program creates some links in /usr/local/lib to the DISLIN libraries.

a) Uncompress the tar.gz file with the command

                  gzip -d     dislin-11.1.darwin.intel.64.tar.gz


b) Restore files from the tar file with the command

                  tar   xvf   dislin-11.1.darwin.intel.64.tar    

c) Change to the extraction directory of DISLIN

                  cd    dislin-11.1

d) Choose a directory in the file structure where DISLIN should be
   installed and define the environment variable DISLIN with it:

                   export DISLIN=$HOME/dislin
    
e) Run the install program with the command 

                   ./INSTALL

   This program copies files to $DISLIN and sets protections.

f) To make DISLIN available for general use, write the following com-
   mands to your .profile or to /etc/profile

                    DISLIN=directory                     
                    export DISLIN
                    PATH=${PATH}:${DISLIN}/bin

                    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DISLIN:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
                    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

   For a C-shell, you should include the commands

                    setenv DISLIN directory                     
                    setenv PATH ${PATH}:${DISLIN}/bin
                    setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ${DISLIN}:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}

   into your .login file.

g) You can delete the directory 'dislin-11.1.


4.) Compiling, Linking and Running the Example Programs
  
   Now you can compile, link and run the example programs in the
   directory $DISLIN/examples with the commands:

                    clink     -a exa_c      (for gcc)       
                    cpplink   -a exa_cpp    (for g++)       
                    dlink     -a exa_f77    (for g77)
                    g95link   -a exa_f90    (for g95)
                    gf77link  -a exa_f77    (for gfortran, Fortran 77)
                    gf95link  -a exa_f90    (for gfortran, Fortran 90/95)
                    iclink    -a exa_c      (for Intel icc)       
                    if77link  -a exa_f77    (for Intel ifort, Fortran 77)
                    if90link  -a exa_f90    (for Intel ifort, Fortran 90/95)

   and
                    clink     -a map_c      (for gcc)       
                    cpplink   -a map_cpp    (for g++)       
                    dlink     -a map_f77    (for g77)
                    g95link   -a map_f90    (for g95)
                    gf77link  -a map_f77    (for gfortran, Fortran 77)
                    gf95link  -a map_f90    (for gfortran, Fortran 90/95)
                    iclink    -a map_c      (for Intel icc)       
                    if77link  -a map_f77    (for Intel ifort, Fortran 77)
                    if90link  -a map_f90    (for Intel ifort, Fortran 90/95)

    Note:   If you use a Fortran 90 compiler such as g95, gfortran and ifort,
            you may have to recompile the file dislin.f90 for getting a
            compatible dislin.mod file for your compiler version.


5.) Using DISLIN from Perl        

   A DISLIN module for the programming language Perl is included in this
   DISLIN distribution. The module and some examples can be found in the
   directory $DISLIN/perl

   To use DISLIN from Perl, you have to define the  environment variable
   PERL5LIB:

             export PERL5LIB=$DISLIN/perl

   Note: The Perl module was created with Perl version 5.11.1. The
         Source code of the module is included in $DISLIN/perl for
         re-creating the module if your Perl version is not compatible
         with the version above.


6.) Using DISLIN from Python        

   An extension module for the programming language Python is also 
   included in  DISLIN for Darwin. The module and examples can be found
   in the directory $DISLIN/python

   To use DISLIN from Python, you have to define the  environment variable
   PYTHONPATH:

             export PYTHONPATH=$DISLIN/python

   Note: The module file 'dislinmodule.so' is created with Python version
         2.6.0. Source code of the Python extension is 
         included in $DISLIN/python for re-creating the module. 


7.) Using DISLIN from Java        

   An interface for the programming language Java is also included in
   the DISLIN distribution for Mac OSX/Intel. It allows to use DISLIN 
   routines from Java applications. The interface and examples can be 
   found in the directory $DISLIN/java. 

   To use DISLIN from Java, you have to define the  environment variable
   CLASSPATH:

             export CLASSPATH=$DISLIN/java/dislin.jar:.
   
   The examples in $DISLIN/java can be compiled and executed with the
   commands

   javac  example.java
   java   example 

   Note: The module file disjava-11.1.so is created with Java version
         1.6.0 Source code of the Java extension is included in 
         $DISLIN/java for re-creating the module. 


8.) Getting a DISLIN License

   DISLIN is free for non-commercial use. Licenses for selling programs
   linked with DISLIN or for using DISLIN in an environment related to
   business are available from the site http://www.dislin.de.
